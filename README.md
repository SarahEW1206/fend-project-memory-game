# Memory Game Project

Note for reviewer: My initial submission had a "RESET" button that I opted to use instead of the little Font Awesome arrow. For some reason, that was not rendering for you when you viewed it. It was set up to reload the page with location.reload(). I took your comment to mean that it was not acceptable to reload the game by reloading the page. SO, I built out code to reset the game without reloading the page! I realized about halfway through, when I saw your screenshot, that you couldn't see my button AT ALL, and that's what you meant in your comment.  Either way - I am glad I took on the challenge of coding the reset functionality rather than taking the easy way out with a page reload ;-)  I hope it all works...I tested it a few times. 

MORE IMPORTANTLY: I hope you can see the button!!  It should be on the left of the score panel. I changed it from a button element to an input with type of button. Please let me know if it's still not showing up for some reason!

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
